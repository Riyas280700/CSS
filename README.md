### **Key Features of the Project:**

1. **Multi-Page Structure:**
   - The website consists of multiple pages, including:
     - **Home Page**: Introduces the company and its services.

3. **Bootstrap Integration:**
   - The project leverages **Bootstrap 5** for styling and layout, including:
     - **Navbar**: A sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the page as users scroll.

   - **Custom CSS** is used to style elements like buttons, headings, and sections, giving the website a unique look.

### **Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - The website could benefit from optimizing image sizes to improve loading times, especially on mobile devices.
